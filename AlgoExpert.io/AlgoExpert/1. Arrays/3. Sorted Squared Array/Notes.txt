Solution 1 is just squaring and then sorting.

Solution 2 is the most optimed soltion by time. As array is sorted so it uses two pointer pattern to solve the problem.

Solution 3 uses same optimal complexity but uses extra space to store the negative numbers and then compare last negative number to current array index 
while inserting smallest number to the result array.
