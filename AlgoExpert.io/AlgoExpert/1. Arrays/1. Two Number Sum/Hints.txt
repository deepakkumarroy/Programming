Hints :

Hint 1
Try using two for loops to sum all possible pairs of numbers in the input array. What are the time and space 
implications of this approach?

Hint 2
Realize that for every number X in the input array, you are essentially trying to find a corresponding number 
Y such that X + Y = targetSum. With two variables in this equation known to you, it shouldn't be hard to solve 
for Y.

Hint 3
Try storing every number in a hash table, solving the equation mentioned in Hint #2 for every number, and 
checking if the Y that you find is stored in the hash table. What are the time and space implications of this 
approach?
