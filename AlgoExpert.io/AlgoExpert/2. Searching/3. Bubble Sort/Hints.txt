Hints :-

Hint 1
Traverse the input array, swapping any two numbers that are out of order and keeping track of any 
swaps that you make. Once you arrive at the end of the array, check if you have made any swaps; if 
not, the array is sorted and you are done; otherwise, repeat the steps laid out in this hint until the 
array is sorted.
